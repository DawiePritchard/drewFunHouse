# Shumba

## Abstract
  - This is the Shumba groups' repository for our IMY 300 project 2017
  - We will be building an RPG game named "#graduateOnTime".
  A description of the core mechanics and other mechanics as well as an overall introduction to the project can be found here - [Game Concept Document](./Documentation/GameConceptDocument-Shumba.pdf)

## For Lecturers
- The project files are quite bloated due to a number of assets that were not used in the implementation of the prototype, this includes scripts, materials and models, prefabs etc found in the standard assets supplied by Unity, and some form the asset store that I used while playing around and exploring the environment.
- The only one of these assets I used is the third person character (Ethan), and even then I have modified the ThirdPersonCharacterController scripts to fit some requirements needed by the prototype.
- The scripts I created are stored within the project files amongst the other Unity supplied scripts and here - [Scripts](./Scripts)
